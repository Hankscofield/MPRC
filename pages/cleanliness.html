        <h2>Why Cleanliness Matters</h2>
        <p>The cleanliness of our parks directly reflects the values and pride of our community. Clean parks invite more visitors, encourage longer stays, and foster a sense of ownership among community members. When parks are well-maintained, they become destinations that enhance quality of life for everyone in the neighborhood.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond aesthetics, park cleanliness has profound implications for public health and environmental protection. Improperly disposed waste attracts pests and vermin that can carry diseases. Food scraps left behind can harm wildlife that consume them. Plastic and other non-biodegradable materials can persist in the environment for centuries, leaching harmful chemicals into soil and water.</p>
        
        <p>The economic impact of park cleanliness should not be underestimated either. Clean parks increase property values in surrounding areas, attract tourists and visitors who contribute to local economies, and reduce the costs associated with intensive cleanup efforts that become necessary when maintenance is neglected.</p>

        <h3>The Butterfly Effect of Litter</h3>
        <p>Research in behavioral psychology has demonstrated that littered environments encourage more littering—a phenomenon sometimes called the "broken window theory." When visitors see trash on the ground, they unconsciously receive permission to add to it. Conversely, pristine environments inspire people to maintain that cleanliness. Every piece of litter you pick up, every wrapper you properly dispose of, contributes to creating an environment that discourages future littering.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>A Clean Park Is Everyone's Responsibility</h4>
          <p>While park staff work diligently to maintain cleanliness, they cannot be everywhere at once. The only way to keep parks truly clean is for every visitor to take personal responsibility for their own waste and, when possible, to go the extra mile by picking up litter they encounter. This collective effort is what transforms a park from merely maintained to genuinely pristine.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Understanding Waste Categories</h3>
        <p>Different types of waste have different environmental impacts and require different disposal methods:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Organic waste (food scraps):</strong> While biodegradable, food waste in parks can attract pests, create odors, and harm wildlife that aren't adapted to consume human food. Always dispose of food waste in bins, not on the ground.</li>
          <li><strong>Plastics:</strong> Extremely persistent in the environment, plastics can take hundreds of years to break down while releasing harmful chemicals. Many plastic items can be recycled if disposed of properly.</li>
          <li><strong>Paper products:</strong> Generally biodegradable but can still contribute to litter and attract pests. Many paper products are recyclable if clean and dry.</li>
          <li><strong>Glass and metal:</strong> Do not biodegrade but are highly recyclable. Glass can pose safety hazards if broken.</li>
          <li><strong>Cigarette butts:</strong> One of the most littered items globally, cigarette butts contain toxic chemicals that leach into soil and water, and take years to decompose.</li>
          <li><strong>Pet waste:</strong> Contains harmful bacteria and parasites that can contaminate soil and water. Must be collected and disposed of in designated receptacles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Trash Overflow Solutions</h2>
        <p>One of the most frustrating situations park visitors encounter is finding all available trash bins overflowing. While this indicates a need for more frequent collection (which you should report to MPRC), it doesn't excuse improper disposal. Here are your options when bins are full:</p>

        <h3>Immediate Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Take it with you:</strong> The simplest and most reliable solution is to carry your waste out of the park and dispose of it at home or in a public bin elsewhere. Always keep a spare plastic bag in your pocket or bag for this purpose.</li>
          <li><strong>Find an alternative bin:</strong> Many parks have multiple collection points. If one is full, walk to another area of the park to find a bin with space available.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask park staff:</strong> If you encounter park workers, ask them to point you to bins that aren't full, or they may be able to empty a bin for you.</li>
          <li><strong>Compact your waste:</strong> Before approaching the bin, compress your waste as small as possible. Crush bottles and cans, compress food containers, and bundle items together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What NOT to Do When Bins Are Full</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Never pile trash on top:</strong> Trash piled on top of overflowing bins quickly falls to the ground, creating a larger mess. It also signals to others that littering is acceptable.</li>
          <li><strong>Never leave trash beside bins:</strong> Trash left on the ground beside bins is still litter. It will scatter with wind or be spread by animals.</li>
          <li><strong>Never throw from a distance:</strong> Attempting to throw trash into a full bin from a distance will almost certainly result in a miss.</li>
          <li><strong>Never walk away assuming it's okay:</strong> There is no situation where leaving trash on the ground is the correct choice. If you cannot find an empty bin, take your trash with you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reporting Overflow</h3>
        <p>Full bins are an infrastructure issue that park management needs to know about. Use the MPRC reporting system to notify authorities about consistently overflowing bins. Include information about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Specific location of the full bin(s)</li>
          <li>Approximate time and day you observed the issue</li>
          <li>Whether this is a recurring problem</li>
          <li>Photo documentation if possible</li>
          <li>Suggestions for improved placement or increased collection frequency</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box info">
          <h4>Proactive Waste Reduction</h4>
          <p>The best way to deal with overflowing bins is to help prevent them from filling in the first place. Consider using reusable containers instead of disposable ones, packing only what you'll consume to minimize food waste, and choosing products with minimal packaging. When everyone reduces their waste footprint, bins stay manageable longer.</p>

              <h2>Dog Waste Rules</h2>
              <p>Dog owners bear special responsibility for maintaining park cleanliness. Pet waste is not only unsightly and unpleasant but also poses genuine health risks to other park visitors, children, and even other pets.</p>

            <div class="impact-text">
              <h3>Why Dog Waste Is a Serious Issue</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Disease transmission:</strong> Dog feces can contain harmful bacteria like E. coli and Salmonella, parasites like roundworms and hookworms, and viruses that can be transmitted to humans and other animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Water pollution:</strong> When dog waste washes into storm drains, it contaminates water supplies with pathogens and excess nutrients that can harm aquatic ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Lawn damage:</strong> Dog waste is highly acidic and will kill grass and plants where it's left, creating brown spots throughout the park.</li>
                <li><strong>Unpleasant experience:</strong> Nothing ruins a park visit faster than stepping in or sitting near dog waste. It's disrespectful to other visitors and park workers.</li>

              <h3>Proper Dog Waste Management</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Always carry waste bags:</strong> Never enter a park with your dog without at least 2-3 waste bags. Keep bags attached to the leash or in your pocket for easy access.</li>
                <li><strong>Pick up immediately:</strong> Collect waste as soon as your dog has finished, before you walk away. Don't plan to "get it on the way back."</li>
                <li><strong>Use bags properly:</strong> Place your hand inside the bag like a glove, pick up the waste, then invert the bag over it and tie securely.</li>
                <li><strong>Use designated bins:</strong> Dispose of bagged waste in designated pet waste bins or general trash bins. Never leave bags on the ground, even tied.</li>
                <li><strong>Carry out if needed:</strong> If no bins are available, carry the bagged waste until you find one or take it home for disposal.</li>
              </ol>

          <p>Some dog owners mistakenly believe that dog waste is "natural" and will simply decompose.

Responsible pet ownership absolutely requires collecting and properly disposing of your dog's waste every single time.</p>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What should I do if I see someone littering?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Approaching someone about littering can be uncomfortable, but gentle education can make a difference. If you feel comfortable, you might say something like "Excuse me, it looks like something fell out of your bag" to give them an opportunity to correct the behavior without confrontation. Alternatively, you can simply pick up the litter yourself and dispose of it properly—this silent demonstration of good behavior can be influential. If you observe repeated or serious littering, report it through MPRC.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Absolutely! Bringing your own garbage bags is highly encouraged. It ensures you can always carry out your waste, helps you separate recyclables, and allows you to pick up any litter you encounter during your visit. Keep a few foldable bags in your regular bag or pocket so you're always prepared for park visits.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Even items labeled as "compostable" or "biodegradable" should not be left in parks. These items require specific composting conditions (temperature, moisture, microorganisms) to break down properly, which don't exist when items are left on the ground in a park. Without proper composting, these items create litter just like conventional materials. Dispose of them in bins or take them home for composting if you have a home composting system.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Teaching children good park cleanliness habits is a gift that lasts a lifetime. Make waste disposal a game—who can spot the most litter to pick up? Who can throw their trash in the bin from the closest distance? Give children their own small bags for collecting their trash and praise them for responsible disposal. Explain why cleanliness matters in terms they can understand: "If we leave food here, it might make a bird sick." Most importantly, model the behavior you want them to learn—children learn most from observing their parents and caregivers.</p>

            <div class="faq-question">Is it okay to leave food for birds or squirrels?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No, leaving food for wildlife—even seemingly harmless birds or squirrels—is not appropriate park behavior. Human food is often unhealthy for wildlife and can cause nutritional imbalances, digestive problems, and disease. Feeding wildlife also makes animals dependent on humans, alters their natural behaviors, and can lead to overpopulation and aggressive behavior. Food scraps also attract pests like rats and can spoil, creating odors and hygiene issues. If you want to enjoy wildlife, observe them from a distance as they forage for their natural foods.</p>

        <h2>Behavior Scenarios</h2>
        <p>The following scenarios illustrate common cleanliness situations and the best ways to handle them.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 1: The Packed Picnic</h3>
        <div class="scenario-box good">
          <span class="scenario-label">Good Response</span>
          <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A group of friends brings an elaborate picnic with multiple containers, bottles, napkins, and food items. After eating, they have a substantial amount of waste.</p>
          <p><strong>Good Response:</strong> Before the picnic, they designated one large bag as the "trash bag" and assigned one person to manage it. Throughout the meal, everyone places their trash in the bag. After eating, they do a final sweep of the area, checking under the mat and in the grass for any dropped items. They find that the nearest bin is nearly full, so they tie up their bag and carry it to a less-full bin on the other side of the park. One friend walks around the immediate area picking up a few stray pieces of litter left by previous visitors. They leave the spot cleaner than they found it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scenario-box bad">
          <span class="scenario-label">Poor Response</span>
          <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Same picnic scenario with the group of friends.</p>
          <p><strong>Poor Response:</strong> No one thinks about waste management before the picnic. During the meal, napkins blow away and no one chases them. Afterward, they stuff everything into a small bag and try to force it into an already-overflowing bin. When it doesn't fit, they leave the bag on the ground beside the bin. They don't check the picnic area before leaving, missing several bottle caps and a piece of plastic wrap that blew under the table.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Scenario 2: The Morning Walker</h3>
        <div class="scenario-box good">
          <span class="scenario-label">Good Response</span>
          <p><strong>Situation:</strong> An elderly man takes his daily morning walk through the park and notices scattered litter from the previous evening.</p>
          <p><strong>Good Response:</strong> He carries a small bag during his walks specifically for this purpose. As he walks, he picks up visible litter that he passes—a few plastic bottles, some food wrappers, and a discarded newspaper. He doesn't feel obligated to clean the entire park, but he contributes what he can. He deposits the collected litter in a bin at the park exit. He notices that the same area seems littered every morning and decides to report the pattern to MPRC so that park management can consider adding a bin or increasing evening patrols in that area.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Scenario 3: The Dog Owner Dilemma</h3>
        <div class="scenario-box good">
          <span class="scenario-label">Good Response</span>
          <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A woman is walking her dog when it stops to defecate near a children's playground.</p>
          <p><strong>Good Response:</strong> She immediately uses a waste bag to pick up the waste, even though the area is close to where children play and she feels embarrassed. She ties the bag securely and looks for a waste bin. Not finding one immediately nearby, she carries the bag with her for the rest of her walk and disposes of it at a bin near the park exit.

          <span class="scenario-label">Poor Response</span>
          <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Same dog walking scenario.</p>
          <p><strong>Poor Response:</strong> She sees that no one is watching and pretends not to notice her dog defecating. She quickly walks away, hoping no one will realize it was her dog. Or, she picks up the waste but sees no bin nearby, so she leaves the tied bag on the ground, thinking park workers will collect it later. Or, she carries the bag but finds a bin that is nearly full and places the bag on top of the pile, from which it later falls to the ground.</p>
