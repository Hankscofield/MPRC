        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-section">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">1. How are user reports processed in the MPRC system?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>When you submit a report through MPRC, it enters our multi-stage processing pipeline designed to ensure every concern receives appropriate attention and action.</p>
              
              <h4>Stage 1: Initial Submission and Validation (0-4 hours)</h4>
              <p>Upon submission, your report is automatically logged with a unique tracking number. Our system validates the information provided, including checking that the location is within our service area, the category is correctly assigned, and any attached photos or documents are properly formatted. Reports with complete information move forward immediately; incomplete reports may trigger a request for additional details.</p>
              
              <h4>Stage 2: Review and Categorization (4-24 hours)</h4>
              <p>MPRC staff review each report to assess its urgency, determine the appropriate government department or agency responsible, and assign a priority level. Reports are categorized by type (maintenance, safety, cleanliness, vandalism, environmental, etc.) and tagged with relevant attributes that help with routing and tracking.</p>
              
              <h4>Stage 3: Routing to Government Agency (24-48 hours)</h4>
              <p>Once categorized, reports are transmitted to the appropriate government department through our established communication channels. Each agency has a designated point of contact who receives MPRC reports and is responsible for internal assignment. We maintain relationships with multiple departments including Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Environmental Services, and Emergency Services.</p>
              
              <h4>Stage 4: Action and Resolution (Varies by issue)</h4>
              <p>The government agency creates a work order, schedules the necessary action, and dispatches personnel to address the issue. Resolution times vary based on the nature of the problem, from same-day for urgent hazards to several weeks for complex repairs.</p>
              
              <h4>Stage 5: Verification and Closure</h4>
              <p>Once work is completed, the resolution is documented and verified. MPRC updates the report status and notifies you that your concern has been addressed.</p>
              
              <div class="next-steps">
                <strong>What you should do next:</strong> After submitting a report, save your tracking number and check back periodically for status updates. If you don't see acknowledgment within 48 hours, contact MPRC support.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">2. How do complaints reach government departments?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>MPRC has established formal partnerships with various government departments responsible for park maintenance and public spaces. These partnerships define clear communication channels, responsibilities, and response expectations.</p>
              
              <h4>Our Government Partners</h4>
              <p>We work with multiple agencies depending on the nature of the issue:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Parks and Recreation Department:</strong> General park maintenance, landscaping, benches, tables, lighting, and recreational facilities</li>
                <li><strong>Public Works Department:</strong> Infrastructure issues, pathways, bridges, water features, and major repairs</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Services:</strong> Trash collection, recycling, pest control, and water quality issues</li>
                <li><strong>Public Safety:</strong> Vandalism, theft, suspicious activity, and safety hazards requiring immediate attention</li>
                <li><strong>Wildlife and Forestry:</strong> Tree health, invasive species, injured wildlife, and ecological concerns</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Transmission Methods</h4>
              <p>Reports are transmitted through secure digital channels established with each department. Urgent reports may also trigger direct phone notifications to on-call personnel. All transmissions are documented with timestamps for accountability.</p>
              
              <h4>Accountability Measures</h4>
              <p>Each partner agency has agreed to acknowledge receipt of reports within specified timeframes and provide regular status updates. MPRC tracks response times and escalates to supervisory levels when acknowledgment or action deadlines are missed.</p>
              
              <div class="next-steps">
                <strong>What you should do next:</strong> Submit your report with as much detail as possible, including clear location information and photos. This helps us route to the correct department immediately.

            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">3. What evidence is required for a report to be actionable?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>While any report can be submitted, more complete evidence results in faster processing and better outcomes. Here's what makes a report most effective:</p>
              
              <h4>Essential Information</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> As specific as possible—park name, section, landmarks, or GPS coordinates. "Near the large banyan tree by the north entrance" is better than "in the park."</li>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Clear explanation of the issue. What exactly is the problem? How severe is it?</li>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> When did you observe this? Is it a recurring issue?</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Highly Recommended</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Clear images showing the issue from multiple angles. Include context (surroundings) and detail (close-up of the problem).</li>
                <li><strong>Scale reference:</strong> Including a common object in photos helps show size and severity.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact description:</strong> How is this affecting park users? Has anyone been injured or inconvenienced?</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Helpful Additional Details</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>History: Has this happened before? Was it previously reported or repaired?</li>
                <li>Cause: If you know or suspect how the issue occurred</li>
                <li>Urgency assessment: Why you believe this needs immediate attention (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Suggested solution: If you have practical ideas for resolution</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>What Happens with Limited Evidence</h4>
              <p>Reports with minimal information can still be processed, but may take longer as staff need to investigate or request additional details. Reports without location information cannot be processed until location is clarified.</p>
              
              <div class="next-steps">
                <strong>What you should do next:</strong> Before submitting, take multiple clear photos and note the exact location using landmarks. The more detail you provide, the faster we can help.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">4. Can I report issues anonymously?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, MPRC supports anonymous reporting for those who prefer not to provide personal information. However, there are trade-offs to consider when choosing anonymous submission.</p>
              
              <h4>Anonymous Reporting: How It Works</h4>
              <p>You can submit reports without creating an account or providing contact information. Simply use the "Report Anonymously" option when submitting. Your report will be processed through the same pipeline as identified reports.</p>
              
              <h4>Advantages of Anonymous Reporting</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Privacy protection—your identity is not linked to the report</li>
                <li>Comfort reporting sensitive issues</li>
                <li>No account creation required</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Limitations of Anonymous Reporting</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>No status updates:</strong> We cannot notify you of progress or resolution</li>
                <li><strong>No follow-up:</strong> If we need clarification, we cannot contact you</li>
                <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> You cannot check on the status of your report</li>
                <li><strong>Potentially slower processing:</strong> Reports requiring clarification may be delayed</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Middle Ground Options</h4>
              <p>If you want updates but prefer some privacy:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Email-only account:</strong> Create an account with only an email address for tracking and updates</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymous with tracking:</strong> We can provide a tracking number for anonymous reports if requested</li>
              </ul>
              
              <div class="next-steps">
                <strong>What you should do next:</strong> Consider whether you want to track your report's progress. If yes, use at least an email address. If reporting sensitive matters, use the anonymous option but provide detailed information since we cannot ask follow-up questions.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">5. What is the process for urgent hazards that need immediate attention?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Urgent hazards receive expedited processing through a separate fast-track pipeline designed to protect public safety.</p>
              
              <h4>What Qualifies as Urgent</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Immediate danger:</strong> Anything posing imminent risk of injury (fallen tree across path, exposed electrical wires, deep sinkholes)</li>
                <li><strong>Structural collapse:</strong> Playground equipment failure, damaged bridges, falling debris</li>
                <li><strong>Health hazards:</strong> Sewage leaks, chemical spills, dangerous animal sightings</li>
                <li><strong>Security threats:</strong> Active crimes, suspicious persons, bomb threats (these should also go to police)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Urgent Hazard Processing</h4>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Immediate flag:</strong> Reports marked as urgent are flagged for immediate review</li>
                <li><strong>24/7 monitoring:</strong> Urgent reports are monitored by on-call staff even outside business hours</li>
                <li><strong>Direct escalation:</strong> Urgent reports are transmitted directly to emergency contacts at relevant agencies</li>
                <li><strong>Parallel notification:</strong> Multiple departments may be notified simultaneously</li>
                <li><strong>Status tracking:</strong> Urgent reports receive real-time status updates</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4>Expected Response Times</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Acknowledgment: Within 1 hour</li>
                <li>Initial assessment: Within 4 hours</li>
                <li>Hazard mitigation (warning signs, barriers): Same day</li>
                <li>Permanent resolution: As soon as practically possible</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Important Note</h4>
              <p>For life-threatening emergencies, always call emergency services (police, fire, ambulance) first, then report to MPRC. We are not an emergency response service.</p>
              
              <div class="next-steps">
                <strong>What you should do next:</strong> If you encounter an urgent hazard, mark your report as "Urgent" and provide the clearest possible description of the danger. If people are in immediate danger, call emergency services before submitting an MPRC report.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">6. How should I report safety concerns differently from general maintenance issues?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Safety concerns require a different approach than general maintenance requests to ensure they receive appropriate urgency and routing.</p>
              
              <h4>Classifying Safety vs. Maintenance</h4>
              <p><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Issues that could cause injury or illness</li>
                <li>Problems affecting structural integrity</li>
                <li>Hazards to children or vulnerable populations</li>
                <li>Threats to public health</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>Maintenance Issues:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Cosmetic problems (peeling paint, minor cracks)</li>
                <li>Functional inconveniences (squeaky swings, slow-draining fountains)</li>
                <li>Cleanliness issues (litter, graffiti, dirty benches)</li>
                <li>Landscape concerns (overgrown bushes, weedy flower beds)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Reporting Safety Concerns</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Select "Safety Concern" as the report category</li>
                <li>Describe the specific hazard clearly</li>
                <li>Explain how someone could be injured</li>
                <li>Note if anyone has already been injured</li>
                <li>Indicate whether the area is currently accessible to the public</li>
                <li>Provide photos showing the hazard</li>

              <h4>Temporary Precautions</h4>
              <p>If safe to do so, you can help protect others while waiting for official response:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Warn other park users about the hazard</li>
                <li>If equipment is dangerous, suggest people avoid using it</li>
                <li>Do NOT attempt repairs yourself</li>
                <li>Do NOT create permanent barriers or signs (leave this to authorities)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <div class="next-steps">
                <strong>What you should do next:</strong> When reporting, clearly categorize your issue as a safety concern if there's any injury risk. Be specific about the nature of the danger and who might be affected.

            <div class="faq-question">7. What happens when I submit repeated complaints about the same issue?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Repeated complaints are taken seriously and trigger escalation procedures, but they're handled differently depending on the circumstances.</p>
              
              <h4>If the Issue Was Never Resolved</h4>
              <p>If you submitted a previous report that was marked as resolved but the problem persists or has returned:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Your new report is linked to the previous one</li>
                <li>The issue is automatically flagged for supervisor review</li>
                <li>Higher priority may be assigned</li>
                <li>Quality assurance investigation may be triggered</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>If the Issue Is Recurring</h4>
              <p>Some issues genuinely recur (trash overflow, vandalism in same location, seasonal problems):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Multiple reports help document the pattern</li>
                <li>Patterns may trigger systemic changes (more frequent pickup, surveillance, design changes)</li>
                <li>Your reports contribute to data that justifies resource allocation</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>If Resolution Is Still Pending</h4>
              <p>If you submit a new report while a previous one is still open:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The new report is merged with the existing one</li>
                <li>Additional information is added to the case file</li>
                <li>You'll receive a note that your previous report is still in progress</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>How to Reference Previous Reports</h4>
              <p>When submitting about an ongoing or recurring issue, include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Previous report tracking number(s) if you have them</li>
                <li>Dates of previous reports</li>
                <li>Description of what happened (or didn't happen) after previous report</li>
                <li>Any new information or changes since last report</li>
              </ul>
              
              <div class="next-steps">
                <strong>What you should do next:</strong> Keep records of your report tracking numbers. If an issue persists, reference previous reports in your new submission to help us track the pattern.

            <div class="faq-question">10. What should I do about persistent trash overflow problems?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Trash overflow is one of the most commonly reported issues and can indicate a need for systemic changes rather than just one-time cleanup.</p>
              
              <h4>Single Incident vs. Recurring Problem</h4>
              <p><strong>For a single incident:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Report the overflowing bin location</li>
                <li>Note approximate fullness level and what's overflowing</li>
                <li>Time and day of observation</li>
                <li>Environmental Services will dispatch for cleanup</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>For recurring overflow:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Document multiple instances with dates and times</li>
                <li>Note patterns (always overflows by Sunday afternoon, etc.)</li>
                <li>Photos showing the progression of the problem</li>
                <li>This documentation helps justify collection schedule changes</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>What MPRC Does with Trash Reports</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Individual reports trigger immediate pickup requests</li>
                <li>Pattern data is analyzed to optimize collection schedules</li>
                <li>High-overflow locations may receive additional or larger bins</li>
                <li>Severe ongoing issues may result in collection frequency increases</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Contributing Factors to Include</h4>
              <p>If you notice reasons for the overflow, include them:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Special events in the park</li>
                <li>Unusual weather driving more visitors</li>
                <li>Specific activities generating extra waste (picnics, festivals)</li>
                <li>Bins that are undersized for the area's usage</li>
                <li>Poor bin placement that visitors may not find easily</li>
              </ul>
              
              <div class="next-steps">
                <strong>What you should do next:</strong> Report the immediate overflow for cleanup. If you've observed the same bin overflowing repeatedly, mention the pattern and include dates of previous observations. Your cumulative reports help build the case for improved service.

              <h4>First Steps</h4>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Verify the resolution:</strong> Visit the location to confirm the current state</li>
                <li><strong>Document remaining issues:</strong> Take photos showing what still needs attention</li>
                <li><strong>Review the resolution notes:</strong> Check what action was reported as taken</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4>If the Problem Persists</h4>
              <ul>

                <li>Clearly explain what was done and what still needs attention</li>

                <li>Provide all relevant tracking numbers and documentation</li>

              </ul>
              
              <h4>Feedback Importance</h4>
