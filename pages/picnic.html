        <h2>Using Picnic Areas Properly</h2>
        <p>Picnic areas are among the most popular features of parks, providing spaces for families and friends to gather, eat, celebrate, and enjoy the outdoors together. Proper use of these areas ensures everyone has a pleasant experience.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Finding and Claiming Picnic Spots</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>First come, first served:</strong> Most picnic areas operate on this principle. Arriving early, especially on weekends or holidays, improves your chances of finding a good spot.</li>
          <li><strong>Reservations:</strong> Some parks allow reservations for specific areas, especially for large gatherings. Check with park management about reservation options.</li>
          <li><strong>Claiming unoccupied tables:</strong> You may leave a tablecloth or small items to indicate a table is in use while you unload, but don't "reserve" tables for extended periods before actually using them.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect others' claims:</strong> If a table has items on it, assume it's occupied even if no one is present at the moment.</li>
          <li><strong>Space between groups:</strong> When choosing a spot, leave reasonable distance between your group and others. Don't set up right next to another group when space is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Setting Up Your Picnic</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use tables for their purpose:</strong> Picnic tables are for eating, not for sleeping, standing on, or using as workout benches.</li>
          <li><strong>Contain your area:</strong> Keep your belongings, food, and activities within a reasonable footprint. Don't spread across multiple tables if you don't need them.</li>
          <li><strong>Anchor lightweight items:</strong> Wind can blow away napkins, plates, and wrappers. Use weights or clips to keep items secure.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider the ground:</strong> If picnicking on grass, use a blanket or mat. Avoid sitting on wet grass that may result in damaged turf.</li>
          <li><strong>Position for convenience:</strong> Set up near a trash bin if possible to encourage easy, proper disposal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Duration of Use</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Be mindful of others waiting:</strong> On busy days, be aware if others are looking for picnic spots. While there's no strict time limit, extended monopolization of prime spots isn't considerate.</li>
          <li><strong>Reasonable duration:</strong> A typical picnic of 2-3 hours is normal. All-day occupation of a table may not be appropriate on crowded days.</li>
          <li><strong>Rotate if needed:</strong> If you're planning an extended stay and the area is crowded, consider moving to a less-in-demand location after eating to free up the table for others.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>Sharing the Space</h4>
          <p>On very busy days, you might consider sharing a large picnic table with another small group. A friendly "Would you like to share this table?" can turn a space conflict into an opportunity for community connection. Many pleasant conversations and even friendships have started with shared picnic tables.</p>

        <h2>Clean-Up Expectations</h2>

        <p>The most important aspect of picnic etiquette is leaving your area clean—ideally cleaner than you found it. Your clean-up directly affects the experience of the next users and the overall health of the park.</p>
        
      <div class="cleanup-illustration">
        <img src="../resources/park13.jpg" alt="Clean picnic area showing proper cleanup">
      </div>
        <h3>Clean-Up Checklist</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Collect all obvious trash:</strong> Gather plates, napkins, wrappers, bottles, and other visible waste into a trash bag.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the ground:</strong> Walk around your entire area looking for fallen items, food scraps, and small pieces of litter that may have blown or fallen.</li>
          <li><strong>Check under tables and benches:</strong> Items often end up in these hidden spots.</li>
          <li><strong>Wipe down tables:</strong> If you spilled anything or the table is sticky, wipe it down. Consider bringing a cloth for this purpose.</li>
          <li><strong>Dispose of trash properly:</strong> Use the nearest bins. If bins are full, take your trash with you.</li>
          <li><strong>Remove all belongings:</strong> Don't leave behind tablecloths, dishes, toys, or decorations.</li>
          <li><strong>Check for food residue:</strong> Ensure no food scraps remain that could attract pests.</li>
          <li><strong>Final sweep:</strong> Take one last look around before leaving.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="cleanup-illustration">
          <img src="../resources/park14.jpg" alt="Visual checklist of cleanup steps">
        </div>

        <h3>Handling Different Types of Waste</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Food waste:</strong> All uneaten food should go in the trash, not on the ground "for birds" or scattered in bushes. This includes fruit peels, seeds, and cores.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquids:</strong> Don't pour liquids on the ground. Dispose of beverages in trash bins or take containers home.</li>
          <li><strong>Recyclables:</strong> If recycling bins are available, separate recyclable items. Crush bottles and cans to save space.</li>
          <li><strong>Hot coals or ash:</strong> If grilling is permitted and you've used a park-provided grill, ensure coals are completely cool before leaving. Use provided ash disposal areas if available.</li>
          <li><strong>Party decorations:</strong> Balloons, streamers, confetti, and other decorations must all be removed. Balloons are especially dangerous to wildlife.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
        <h3>Going Beyond the Minimum</h3>
        <p>Excellent picnic etiquette means not just cleaning up after yourself, but leaving the area better than you found it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pick up any litter left by previous users</li>
          <li>Wipe down the table even if your group didn't dirty it</li>
          <li>Report any maintenance issues you notice (damaged tables, overflowing bins, etc.)</li>
          <li>If you see an incoming group, offer to show them where the bins are located</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Fire and Smoke Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Fire and smoke from grilling, barbecues, or other sources require special consideration in park settings due to safety concerns and impact on other visitors.</p>
        
        <h3>Grilling and Barbecue</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use designated areas only:</strong> Many parks have specific areas with grills or designated for barbecues. Do not grill in other areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Check if grilling is permitted:</strong> Not all parks allow grilling. Check signs or park rules before planning a barbecue.</li>
          <li><strong>Use provided equipment:</strong> When park-provided grills are available, use them rather than bringing your own (unless personal grills are specifically permitted).</li>
          <li><strong>Portable grills:</strong> If portable grills are allowed, use them only in designated areas, place them on stable surfaces, and never on picnic tables.</li>
          <li><strong>Fire safety:</strong> Have water or a fire extinguisher nearby. Never leave a lit grill unattended. Fully extinguish before leaving.</li>
          <li><strong>Coal disposal:</strong> Wait until coals are completely cool before disposal. Use provided ash bins if available. Never dump hot coals on the ground or in regular trash bins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Smoke Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Position for wind:</strong> Set up grills downwind from other picnic groups when possible so smoke doesn't blow toward them.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimize smoke:</strong> Use good quality fuel and proper grilling technique to reduce excessive smoke.</li>
          <li><strong>Be responsive:</strong> If smoke is affecting nearby groups, apologize and do what you can to minimize it.</li>
          <li><strong>Cigarette smoking:</strong> Follow park rules regarding smoking. Many parks prohibit smoking or restrict it to designated areas. Never smoke near playgrounds, athletic fields, or other areas where children gather.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Open Fires</h3>
        <p>Open fires (campfires, bonfires) are typically prohibited in urban parks. Even in parks where fire pits exist:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use only designated fire pits</li>
          <li>Follow all posted rules about fire size and duration</li>
          <li>Never leave fires unattended</li>
          <li>Completely extinguish fires before leaving (drown, stir, feel for heat, repeat)</li>
          <li>Be aware of fire danger conditions—fires may be prohibited during dry periods</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box warning">
          <h4>Fire Safety Is Everyone's Responsibility</h4>
          <p>Fires in parks can quickly become dangerous, spreading to dry vegetation and threatening both people and property. Never assume "just a small fire" is safe. Follow all rules, never leave fires unattended, and report any unattended fires or concerning fire behavior to park staff immediately.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Safety Behavior</h2>
        <p>Picnic and family areas should be safe spaces for everyone, especially children. Good safety behavior protects your family and others around you.</p>
        
        <h3>Child Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Active supervision:</strong> Always know where your children are and what they're doing. Don't assume the park is safe enough for unsupervised play.</li>
          <li><strong>Establish boundaries:</strong> Set clear rules about how far children can roam from the picnic area and where they shouldn't go.</li>
          <li><strong>Buddy system:</strong> If multiple children are present, pair them up so no child wanders alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Know the area:</strong> Identify water features, roads, park exits, and other potential hazards. Make children aware of these.</li>
          <li><strong>Meeting point:</strong> Establish a specific meeting point in case anyone gets separated.</li>
          <li><strong>Stranger awareness:</strong> Remind children about stranger safety without causing anxiety. They should know to come to you if anyone makes them uncomfortable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Food Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> Use insulated coolers with ice packs to keep perishable foods cold. Food should not sit out unrefrigerated for more than two hours (one hour in hot weather).</li>
          <li><strong>Hand hygiene:</strong> Bring hand sanitizer or wipes for use before eating and after play.</li>
          <li><strong>Separate raw and cooked:</strong> If grilling, keep raw meat separate from other foods and use separate utensils.</li>
          <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> If members of your party have food allergies, be mindful of cross-contamination. If sharing with others, mention any major allergens in your food.</li>
          <li><strong>Cover food:</strong> Keep food covered to prevent insects, dust, and debris from contaminating it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>General Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sun protection:</strong> Use sunscreen, seek shade, and stay hydrated, especially for children and elderly members of your group.</li>
          <li><strong>Insect protection:</strong> Use appropriate insect repellent and be aware of ant hills, wasp nests, and other insect hazards near your picnic spot.</li>
          <li><strong>First aid:</strong> Consider bringing a basic first aid kit for minor cuts, scrapes, and stings.</li>
          <li><strong>Weather awareness:</strong> Watch for changing weather conditions. Move to shelter if thunderstorms approach.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency information:</strong> Know the park address and nearest entrance for emergency services. Keep phones charged.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Food Waste Rules</h2>
        <p>Food waste is one of the biggest challenges in picnic areas. Proper food waste management protects the environment, prevents pest problems, and ensures pleasant conditions for all users.</p>
        
        <h3>The Problems with Improper Food Waste</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pest attraction:</strong> Food scraps attract rats, mice, ants, wasps, and other pests. Once established, these pests become ongoing problems for all park users.</li>
          <li><strong>Wildlife issues:</strong> Food waste draws birds and other wildlife to picnic areas where they may become pests or aggressive, and may consume foods harmful to their health.</li>
          <li><strong>Odor and hygiene:</strong> Rotting food creates unpleasant odors and unsanitary conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual pollution:</strong> Food scraps are ugly and make the park less enjoyable for everyone.</li>
          <li><strong>Soil and water contamination:</strong> Oils, salt, and other food components can harm plants and contaminate water sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proper Food Waste Disposal</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>All food waste goes in bins:</strong> There are no exceptions. Fruit peels, seeds, cores, bones, and scraps all go in the trash.</li>
          <li><strong>Scrape plates clean:</strong> Before putting plates in the trash, scrape off all food residue.</li>
          <li><strong>Seal food waste:</strong> If possible, put food waste in sealed bags before placing in bins to reduce odor and pest attraction.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't overfill bins:</strong> If the bin is full, find another or take your food waste home.</li>
          <li><strong>Dispose of liquids properly:</strong> Soups, sauces, and beverages should be disposed of in bins, not poured on the ground.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reducing Food Waste</h3>
        <p>The best food waste is no food waste:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plan portions carefully to avoid leftovers</li>
          <li>Bring containers to take uneaten food home</li>
          <li>Share excess food with other picnickers (offering politely)</li>
          <li>Choose foods that generate less waste</li>
          <li>Pre-cut and prepare foods at home to reduce scraps generated at the park</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Special Occasions and Celebrations</h2>
        <p>Parks are popular venues for birthday parties, family reunions, and other celebrations. These events require extra planning and consideration.</p>
        
        <h3>Planning Special Events</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check permit requirements:</strong> Large gatherings often require permits. Check with park management in advance.</li>
          <li><strong>Reserve if possible:</strong> For important events, try to reserve a specific area if the park offers this option.</li>
          <li><strong>Visit beforehand:</strong> Scout the location to identify the best spot, locate facilities, and plan logistics.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan for setup and cleanup:</strong> Allocate time and people for both. Don't arrive just before the event or rush away immediately after.</li>
          <li><strong>Prepare for weather:</strong> Have a backup plan for rain or extreme heat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Decorations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No permanent modifications:</strong> Don't nail, tie, or attach anything to trees, structures, or fixtures.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid balloons:</strong> Balloon releases are illegal in many places due to wildlife harm. Even balloons that don't release can escape and cause problems. Consider alternatives like paper decorations or fabric bunting.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure all decorations:</strong> Wind can carry loose decorations across the park. Secure everything well.</li>
          <li><strong>Remove everything:</strong> All decorations must be completely removed when you leave, including tape, string, and confetti.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Managing Larger Groups</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Assign responsibilities:</strong> Designate people to manage specific tasks: food, children supervision, cleanup, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Control noise:</strong> Large groups can become very loud. Designate someone to monitor noise levels.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect boundaries:</strong> Keep your group within your designated or claimed area. Don't let activities spill into neighbors' spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Coordinate parking so your group doesn't monopolize all available spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Cleanup crew:</strong> Assign a cleanup crew to do a thorough job at the end of the event.</li>
        </ul>
