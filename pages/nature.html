        <h3>Common Birds</h3>
        <p>Myanmar's parks host numerous bird species that visitors can observe and enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mynas:</strong> Common, intelligent birds often seen walking on lawns searching for insects. Their varied calls add to the park soundscape.</li>
          <li><strong>Bulbuls:</strong> Cheerful songbirds with melodious calls, often found near flowering plants and fruit trees.</li>
          <li><strong>Crows and Magpies:</strong> Highly intelligent and adaptable, these birds are common in urban parks but should not be fed as they can become aggressive.</li>
          <li><strong>Kingfishers:</strong> Brilliantly colored birds found near water features, ponds, and streams. Their presence indicates healthy aquatic ecosystems.</li>
          <li><strong>Doves and Pigeons:</strong> Common ground feeders that should not be fed bread or human food.</li>
          <li><strong>Egrets and Herons:</strong> Elegant wading birds seen near water features, feeding on fish and insects.</li>
          <li><strong>Sunbirds:</strong> Small, colorful nectar feeders similar to hummingbirds, often seen at flowering plants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Animals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Squirrels:</strong> Agile tree-dwellers commonly seen in parks with mature trees. They collect and store nuts and seeds.</li>
          <li><strong>Chipmunks:</strong> Smaller than squirrels, these striped rodents are shy but can be observed from a distance.</li>
          <li><strong>Geckos and Lizards:</strong> Helpful insect controllers often seen on walls, trees, and rocks. Completely harmless to humans.</li>
          <li><strong>Butterflies:</strong> Parks with diverse plantings attract many butterfly species. Flower gardens are excellent spots for observation.</li>
          <li><strong>Dragonflies:</strong> Found near water features, dragonflies are beneficial insects that consume mosquitoes.</li>
          <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Many park ponds contain fish species including goldfish, koi, and native species. Never release pet fish into park waters.</li>
          <li><strong>Turtles:</strong> Some park ponds host turtle populations. These ancient animals should be observed from a distance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Plants</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rain Trees (Albizia saman):</strong> Large shade trees with wide canopies, commonly found in Myanmar parks.</li>
          <li><strong>Padauk (Pterocarpus macrocarpus):</strong> Myanmar's national tree, known for fragrant yellow flowers.</li>
          <li><strong>Bougainvillea:</strong> Vibrant flowering plants with colorful bracts, common in park landscaping.</li>
          <li><strong>Frangipani (Plumeria):</strong> Fragrant flowering trees with distinctive five-petaled flowers.</li>
          <li><strong>Lotus and Water Lilies:</strong> Aquatic plants found in ponds and water features, culturally significant in Myanmar.</li>
          <li><strong>Orchids:</strong> Some parks feature orchid gardens with spectacular variety.</li>
          <li><strong>Bamboo:</strong> Various bamboo species provide habitat and aesthetic appeal.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>Every Species Has a Role</h4>
          <p>Every plant and animal in the park ecosystem plays a role in maintaining ecological balance. Birds control insect populations. Insects pollinate flowers. Plants provide food and shelter for animals. Decomposers return nutrients to the soil. When we disturb any part of this system—by feeding wildlife, removing plants, or disrupting habitats—we can trigger cascading effects that harm the entire ecosystem.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Rules on Touching or Removing Plants</h2>
        <p>The plants in parks are not just decorations—they are living organisms that support entire ecosystems and took years to grow and establish. Protecting plant life is fundamental to maintaining healthy parks.</p>

        <h3>What You Should Never Do to Plants</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not pick flowers:</strong> Even a single flower taken by each visitor would quickly strip parks of their beauty. Flowers are also crucial for pollinators and seed production.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not break branches:</strong> Broken branches create wounds that invite disease and pests, potentially killing the entire tree.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not carve into bark:</strong> Carving initials or messages damages the tree's protective layer and can lead to infection and death.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not collect seeds or cuttings:</strong> Removing seeds prevents natural regeneration. Taking cuttings is also prohibited in public parks.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not uproot plants:</strong> Removing any plant, no matter how small or common it appears, is vandalism of public property.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not introduce new plants:</strong> Planting seeds or releasing plants (including aquatic plants) can introduce invasive species.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not climb trees:</strong> Climbing damages bark and branches and can harm the tree's health.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not hang items from branches:</strong> Ropes, hammocks, and swings can damage trees and create safety hazards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Appropriate Interactions with Plants</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Observe and appreciate:</strong> Look closely at flowers, leaves, and bark patterns. Notice seasonal changes.</li>
          <li><strong>Photograph:</strong> Take as many photos as you like without touching or disturbing plants.</li>
          <li><strong>Smell (carefully):</strong> You may lean in to smell fragrant flowers without picking or touching them.</li>
          <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Read informational signs about plant species. Teach children about plant life cycles.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay on paths:</strong> Walking off designated paths can compact soil, damage roots, and trample vegetation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
        <p><strong>Medicinal plants:</strong> Some visitors may be tempted to collect plants believed to have medicinal value. This is not permitted in public parks. If you need medicinal plants, obtain them from licensed sellers or cultivate your own.</p>
        <p><strong>Fallen items:</strong> Collecting fallen leaves, seed pods, or flowers from the ground is generally acceptable in small quantities for personal use, but check local park rules.</p>
        <p><strong>Fruit:</strong> Do not pick fruit from trees in public parks. Some parks may have specific rules allowing fruit collection; check signage or ask staff.</p>

            <h2>Dangers of Feeding Wildlife</h2>
            <p>One of the most common—and most harmful—things visitors do is feed wild animals...</p>

        <div class="impact-row reverse">
          <div class="impact-text">
            <h3>Harm to the Animals</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Nutritional problems:</strong> Human food is not appropriate for wildlife. Bread, chips, rice, and other common offerings lack the nutrients animals need and can cause malnutrition, obesity, and digestive problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependency:</strong> Animals that learn to rely on human feeding lose their natural foraging skills. They may starve during times when humans aren't present.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of fear:</strong> Wild animals that associate humans with food lose their natural wariness. This makes them vulnerable to injury or death from cars, predators, or humans who intend harm.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggressive behavior:</strong> Animals competing for food become aggressive—both toward each other and toward humans. Injuries to both people and animals result.</li>
                <li><strong>Population imbalance:</strong> Artificial food sources cause population explosions that the natural environment cannot sustain, leading to disease and mass starvation.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease spread:</strong> Congregation around feeding areas facilitates disease transmission between animals.</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Harm to the Ecosystem</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Overpopulation:</strong> Fed animals reproduce more than the environment can support, straining resources and crowding out other species.</li>
                <li><strong>Disrupted food chains:</strong> When one species becomes artificially abundant, it affects every species it interacts with—prey, predators, and competitors.</li>
                <li><strong>Water pollution:</strong> Uneaten food and excess animal waste near feeding areas pollute water sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetation damage:</strong> Overpopulated animals destroy vegetation in concentrated areas.</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Harm to Other Visitors</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Aggressive animals:</strong> Animals expecting food may approach, harass, or attack visitors who don't feed them.</li>
                <li><strong>Mess and odor:</strong> Areas where feeding occurs become littered with food waste and animal droppings.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease risk:</strong> Close contact with wildlife in feeding areas increases disease transmission risk to humans.</li>
                <li><strong>Degraded experience:</strong> Parks with aggressive, human-habituated wildlife are less pleasant for all visitors.</li>

          <h4>If You Love Wildlife, Don't Feed It</h4>
          <p>The kindest thing you can do for wildlife is observe it from a distance without interference. Wild animals are not pets. They have evolved for millennia to find their own food and survive without human help. When we feed them, we're not helping—we're creating a dependency that ultimately harms them. True appreciation for wildlife means letting it remain wild.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What to Feed Wildlife (Answer: Nothing)</h3>
        <p>There is no safe, appropriate human food for wildlife. Even foods that seem natural can cause harm:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bread:</strong> Provides no nutrition, fills animals up without nourishing them, and causes "angel wing" deformity in ducks and geese.</li>
          <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Can expand in birds' stomachs and cause digestive problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Crackers, chips, snacks:</strong> High in salt, fat, and artificial ingredients harmful to wildlife.</li>
          <li><strong>Fruit:</strong> While natural, offering fruit habituates animals to human feeding with all its associated problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Birdseed:</strong> Should only be used in appropriate feeders at home, not scattered in public parks.</li>
          <li><strong>Pet food:</strong> Attracts rats, can spread disease, and is not appropriate for wild animals.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Common Visitor Mistakes</h2>
        <p>Even well-intentioned visitors often make mistakes that harm wildlife and ecosystems. Being aware of these common errors helps you avoid them.</p>

        <div class="image-section">
          <div class="image-grid">
            <img src="../resources/33.jpg" alt="Family picnic in a public park">
            <img src="../resources/34.jpg" alt="People using picnic tables in a park">
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Mistake 1: "Helping" Baby Animals</h3>
        <p>Every spring, well-meaning people "rescue" baby animals they believe to be orphaned or abandoned. In most cases, the mother is nearby, and human intervention does more harm than good.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fledgling birds:</strong> Young birds leaving the nest often spend time on the ground while learning to fly. The parents are typically watching and feeding them from nearby. Unless injured, leave them alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Baby mammals:</strong> Many mammals leave their young hidden while they forage. The mother will return. Don't assume they're orphaned.</li>
          <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Observe from a distance. If you're certain an animal is injured or orphaned (visible injury, dead parent nearby), contact wildlife authorities—don't attempt rescue yourself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mistake 2: Removing "Pests"</h3>
        <p>Some visitors attempt to kill insects, spiders, or other animals they consider pests. All animals in the park ecosystem have roles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spiders control insect populations</li>
          <li>Wasps are pollinators and pest controllers</li>
          <li>Ants aerate soil and distribute seeds</li>
          <li>Even mosquitoes are food for many species</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Leave all animals alone, even ones you find unpleasant.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 3: Collecting "Souvenirs"</h3>
        <p>Taking natural items from parks seems harmless but creates cumulative harm:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shells:</strong> Provide homes for hermit crabs and other creatures</li>
          <li><strong>Feathers:</strong> May be legally protected (many bird species)</li>
          <li><strong>Rocks and fossils:</strong> Are part of the geological record and habitat</li>
          <li><strong>Seeds:</strong> Prevent natural regeneration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Take photos and memories, not physical items.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 4: Releasing Pets</h3>
        <p>Releasing unwanted pets—fish, turtles, birds, rabbits—into parks causes serious ecological damage. These animals may become invasive, spread disease, suffer and die in an unfamiliar environment, or all of the above. If you can't keep a pet, find a responsible home or contact animal welfare organizations—never release into parks.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 5: Walking Off Trails</h3>
        <p>Seemingly harmless shortcuts and explorations off designated paths cause real damage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Soil compaction prevents plant growth</li>
          <li>Trampling kills ground-dwelling organisms</li>
          <li>Erosion begins at disturbed areas</li>
          <li>Wildlife habitats are disrupted</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stay on designated paths and trails at all times.</p>
