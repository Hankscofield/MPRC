        <h2>Path-Sharing Rules</h2>
        <p>Park pathways are the arteries of the park, connecting different areas and allowing visitors to move safely throughout the space. Proper path-sharing etiquette ensures smooth flow and prevents conflicts between different types of users.</p>
        
        <div class="image-section">

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Basic Rules of the Path</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep right:</strong> Just like roads in Myanmar, walk on the right side of the path. This creates predictable traffic patterns and prevents collisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Pass on the left:</strong> When passing slower users, move to the left briefly, announce yourself politely, pass, then return to the right.</li>
          <li><strong>Single file when needed:</strong> On narrow paths, groups should walk single file to allow others to pass.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't stop in the middle:</strong> If you need to stop, step completely off the path or move to the side. Never stop in the center of a pathway.</li>
          <li><strong>Be aware of your surroundings:</strong> Regularly glance behind you to be aware of faster users approaching.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sharing Paths with Different Users</h3>
        
        <h4>Pedestrians and Joggers</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Joggers should announce their approach ("passing on your left") when coming up behind walkers</li>
          <li>Walkers should not make sudden lateral movements without looking behind first</li>
          <li>If you hear someone approaching from behind, maintain your course—predictability is key</li>
          <li>Groups of walkers should compress to single file when joggers need to pass</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pedestrians and Cyclists</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Cyclists should slow down when approaching pedestrians</li>
          <li>Cyclists must use bells or voice to announce their approach</li>
          <li>Pedestrians should move smoothly to the right when cyclists are passing</li>
          <li>Some paths may be pedestrian-only—cyclists must dismount in these areas</li>
          <li>At intersections, pedestrians generally have right of way unless otherwise marked</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Users with Different Speeds</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster users yield to slower users by going around them</li>
          <li>Slower users help by staying right and allowing passing space</li>
          <li>Be patient with elderly visitors, small children, and those with mobility challenges</li>
          <li>Adjust your speed to conditions—slow down in crowded areas</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box info">
          <h4>The Hierarchy of Yielding</h4>
          <p>In general, users should yield in this order: vehicles yield to cyclists, cyclists yield to joggers, joggers yield to walkers, all yield to people with disabilities, elderly, and children. This creates a culture of consideration where faster, more agile users accommodate those who are slower or less mobile.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Bench Etiquette</h2>
        <p>Park benches are shared resources that provide rest, relaxation, and enjoyment of park views. Proper bench etiquette ensures everyone has fair access to these amenities.</p>

        <h3>Basic Bench Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sit, don't lie:</strong> Unless the park is nearly empty, sitting allows more people to use each bench. Save lying down for very uncrowded times.</li>
          <li><strong>Make room:</strong> If others approach and the bench isn't full, consolidate your belongings to make space.</li>
          <li><strong>Reasonable time limits:</strong> During busy periods, be mindful of how long you occupy a bench. If others are waiting, consider moving on after 15-20 minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave space:</strong> When joining someone on a bench, leave comfortable space between you rather than sitting directly adjacent.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep belongings contained:</strong> Don't spread bags, picnic items, or other belongings across the entire bench.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Playground Awareness</h2>
        <p>Playgrounds are primarily for children, but they're located within shared park spaces where awareness from all users is essential for safety.</p>

        <h3>For Parents and Caregivers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Active supervision:</strong> Stay close enough to intervene if needed. "Supervision from the bench" isn't adequate for young children.</li>
          <li><strong>Know age appropriateness:</strong> Most equipment has age recommendations. Using equipment intended for older children puts younger children at risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Teach sharing:</strong> Help children understand taking turns, not monopolizing equipment, and including others.</li>
          <li><strong>Address conflicts calmly:</strong> If your child has a conflict with another, address it calmly rather than escalating.</li>
          <li><strong>Clean up:</strong> Remove any food, toys, or belongings when you leave.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect closing times:</strong> Leave playgrounds when the park closes or lighting becomes inadequate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Everyone</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Report hazards:</strong> If you notice broken equipment, sharp edges, or other safety hazards, report them immediately through MPRC.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep pets away:</strong> Dogs should not be in playground areas, even if leashed.</li>
          <li><strong>No smoking:</strong> Never smoke in or near playground areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency awareness:</strong> Know the location of the playground and park entrance in case you need to describe it to emergency services.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Blocking Prevention</h2>
        <p>Blocking pathways, entrances, facilities, or sight lines is one of the most common—and most frustrating—etiquette violations in parks. Being aware of how your position affects others prevents many conflicts.</p>

        <h3>Common Blocking Behaviors to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Path conversations:</strong> When you meet a friend on a path, both parties step to the side to chat rather than stopping in the center of the flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Entrance clustering:</strong> Don't gather immediately inside or outside park entrances, gates, or doorways.</li>
          <li><strong>Photo gathering:</strong> When taking photos, be aware of whether you're blocking paths or popular viewpoints. Take your photo and move on rather than extended photo sessions in high-traffic spots.</li>
          <li><strong>Equipment placement:</strong> Position bikes, strollers, picnic supplies, and other equipment so they don't obstruct paths.</li>
          <li><strong>Group formations:</strong> When your group gathers, form a cluster off the path rather than a line across it.</li>
          <li><strong>Device distraction:</strong> Looking at phones while walking often leads to sudden stops in inconvenient locations. Step aside if you need to use your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Being Aware of Sight Lines</h3>
        <p>Beyond physical blocking, consider whether you're blocking others' views:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At scenic viewpoints, take your photos and move to allow others access to the view</li>
          <li>At performances or events, consider the height of those behind you</li>
          <li>When children are watching something (street performance, wildlife), kneel down rather than standing in front of them</li>
          <li>Umbrellas and wide hats can block views—be aware of their impact</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step-by-Step: What to Do When Blocking</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Notice:</strong> Pay attention to whether people are trying to pass or access something you're near</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> Quickly consider if you're in the way or blocking access</li>
          <li><strong>Move:</strong> Step aside promptly and completely, not just a partial shuffle</li>
          <li><strong>Acknowledge:</strong> A brief "sorry" or smile acknowledges the situation positively</li>
          <li><strong>Prevent:</strong> When choosing where to stand or sit, proactively pick locations that won't require moving later</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Accessibility Awareness Tips</h2>
        <p>Parks should be welcoming and accessible to all visitors, including those with disabilities, mobility challenges, sensory impairments, or other special needs. Your awareness and consideration help create an inclusive environment for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Accessibility Needs</h3>
        <p>Accessibility needs are diverse and not always visible. People may need accommodations for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mobility challenges:</strong> Wheelchair users, people with walkers, canes, or crutches, those with limited endurance or pain conditions</li>
          <li><strong>Visual impairments:</strong> People who are blind or have low vision may use white canes, guide dogs, or need verbal assistance</li>
          <li><strong>Hearing impairments:</strong> People who are deaf or hard of hearing may not respond to verbal warnings and need visual cues</li>
          <li><strong>Cognitive or developmental differences:</strong> Some visitors may process information differently or need more time</li>

        <h3>Practical Accessibility Etiquette</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep paths clear:</strong> Never block accessible paths, ramps, or accessible parking areas, even "just for a minute"</li>
          <li><strong>Yield generously:</strong> When encountering wheelchair users or people with mobility devices, step completely off the path to let them pass</li>
          <li><strong>Don't touch mobility devices:</strong> Wheelchairs, walkers, and canes are extensions of the person—don't touch, lean on, or move them without permission</li>
          <li><strong>Guide dogs are working:</strong> Don't pet, distract, or feed guide dogs or service animals. They need to focus on their job.</li>
          <li><strong>Offer assistance appropriately:</strong> It's okay to offer help, but accept "no thank you" gracefully. Ask "Would you like assistance?" rather than assuming or insisting</li>
          <li><strong>Speak directly:</strong> When communicating with someone who has a disability, speak to them directly, not to their companion or caregiver</li>
          <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Allow extra time for people who move or communicate more slowly</li>
          <li><strong>Accessible facilities:</strong> Don't use accessible restrooms or facilities unless you need them</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reporting Accessibility Issues</h3>
        <p>If you notice accessibility problems in the park, report them through MPRC:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Damaged ramps or accessible pathways</li>
          <li>Obstacles blocking accessible routes</li>
          <li>Non-functioning accessible gates or doors</li>
          <li>Missing or damaged accessible parking signs</li>
          <li>Accessible restrooms that are locked or out of service</li>
          <li>Temporary obstacles (construction, event setup) that block accessible routes</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>Accessibility Benefits Everyone</h4>
          <p>Features designed for accessibility often benefit many users: ramps help parents with strollers, benches help those with fatigue, clear signage helps everyone navigate, and wide paths accommodate groups. Supporting accessibility isn't just about helping others—it makes the park better for everyone and for yourself when you might need these features.</p>
