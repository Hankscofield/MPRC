        <h2>Path-Sharing Rules</h2>
        <p>Park pathways are the arteries of the park, connecting different areas and allowing visitors to move safely throughout the space. Proper path-sharing etiquette ensures smooth flow and prevents conflicts between different types of users.</p>
        
        <h3>Basic Rules of the Path</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep right:</strong> Just like roads in Myanmar, walk on the right side of the path. This creates predictable traffic patterns and prevents collisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Pass on the left:</strong> When passing slower users, move to the left briefly, announce yourself politely, pass, then return to the right.</li>
          <li><strong>Single file when needed:</strong> On narrow paths, groups should walk single file to allow others to pass.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't stop in the middle:</strong> If you need to stop, step completely off the path or move to the side. Never stop in the center of a pathway.</li>
          <li><strong>Be aware of your surroundings:</strong> Regularly glance behind you to be aware of faster users approaching.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sharing Paths with Different Users</h3>
        
        <h4>Pedestrians and Joggers</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Joggers should announce their approach ("passing on your left") when coming up behind walkers</li>
          <li>Walkers should not make sudden lateral movements without looking behind first</li>
          <li>If you hear someone approaching from behind, maintain your course—predictability is key</li>
          <li>Groups of walkers should compress to single file when joggers need to pass</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pedestrians and Cyclists</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Cyclists should slow down when approaching pedestrians</li>
          <li>Cyclists must use bells or voice to announce their approach</li>
          <li>Pedestrians should move smoothly to the right when cyclists are passing</li>
          <li>Some paths may be pedestrian-only—cyclists must dismount in these areas</li>
          <li>At intersections, pedestrians generally have right of way unless otherwise marked</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Users with Different Speeds</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster users yield to slower users by going around them</li>
          <li>Slower users help by staying right and allowing passing space</li>
          <li>Be patient with elderly visitors, small children, and those with mobility challenges</li>
          <li>Adjust your speed to conditions—slow down in crowded areas</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box info">
          <h4>The Hierarchy of Yielding</h4>
          <p>In general, users should yield in this order: vehicles yield to cyclists, cyclists yield to joggers, joggers yield to walkers, all yield to people with disabilities, elderly, and children. This creates a culture of consideration where faster, more agile users accommodate those who are slower or less mobile.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Groups on Paths</h3>
        <p>Groups present special path-sharing challenges. When walking with others:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Two abreast maximum:</strong> Walk no more than two people side by side on shared paths</li>
          <li><strong>Compress for passing:</strong> When others need to pass, temporarily go single file</li>
          <li><strong>Don't monopolize:</strong> Large groups should break into smaller subgroups with space between them</li>
          <li><strong>Be aware:</strong> Group conversation can make you less aware of surroundings—assign someone to watch for approaching users</li>
          <li><strong>Meeting spots:</strong> If your group needs to discuss or wait for someone, move completely off the path</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Bench Etiquette</h2>
        <p>Park benches are shared resources that provide rest, relaxation, and enjoyment of park views. Proper bench etiquette ensures everyone has fair access to these amenities.</p>

        <h3>Basic Bench Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sit, don't lie:</strong> Unless the park is nearly empty, sitting allows more people to use each bench. Save lying down for very uncrowded times.</li>
          <li><strong>Make room:</strong> If others approach and the bench isn't full, consolidate your belongings to make space.</li>
          <li><strong>Reasonable time limits:</strong> During busy periods, be mindful of how long you occupy a bench. If others are waiting, consider moving on after 15-20 minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave space:</strong> When joining someone on a bench, leave comfortable space between you rather than sitting directly adjacent.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep belongings contained:</strong> Don't spread bags, picnic items, or other belongings across the entire bench.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sharing Benches with Strangers</h3>
        <p>It's perfectly appropriate to share a bench with someone you don't know. Here's how to do so comfortably:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ask before sitting:</strong> A simple "Is this seat taken?" or "May I sit here?" is courteous</li>
          <li><strong>Respect personal space:</strong> Leave at least one foot of space between you and other occupants</li>
          <li><strong>Conversation is optional:</strong> You're not obligated to chat with bench-mates, but a smile or nod is friendly</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid intrusive behavior:</strong> Don't read over shoulders, stare, or make others uncomfortable</li>
          <li><strong>Be aware of your impact:</strong> Avoid strong fragrances, playing audio, smoking, or eating pungent foods near others</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Priority seating:</strong> Yield bench space to elderly visitors, pregnant women, people with disabilities, and those who appear to need rest</li>
          <li><strong>Wet or dirty benches:</strong> If you discover a bench is wet or dirty, warn approaching users or, if possible, dry/clean it</li>
          <li><strong>Reserved benches:</strong> Some benches may be memorial dedications—treat them with respect</li>
          <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Report damaged benches through MPRC so they can be repaired</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Playground Awareness</h2>
        <p>Playgrounds are primarily for children, but they're located within shared park spaces where awareness from all users is essential for safety.</p>

        <h3>For Parents and Caregivers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Active supervision:</strong> Stay close enough to intervene if needed. "Supervision from the bench" isn't adequate for young children.</li>
          <li><strong>Know age appropriateness:</strong> Most equipment has age recommendations. Using equipment intended for older children puts younger children at risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Teach sharing:</strong> Help children understand taking turns, not monopolizing equipment, and including others.</li>
          <li><strong>Address conflicts calmly:</strong> If your child has a conflict with another, address it calmly rather than escalating.</li>
          <li><strong>Clean up:</strong> Remove any food, toys, or belongings when you leave.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect closing times:</strong> Leave playgrounds when the park closes or lighting becomes inadequate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Adults Without Children</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Avoid lingering:</strong> Adults without children should avoid spending extended time in playground areas, as this can make parents uncomfortable.</li>
          <li><strong>Walk around, not through:</strong> If possible, walk around playground areas rather than through them to reduce interference and safety risks.</li>
          <li><strong>No equipment use:</strong> Playground equipment is designed for children and should not be used by adults for exercise or sitting.</li>
          <li><strong>Mind your speed:</strong> If passing near a playground, slow down—children can dart unpredictably into your path.</li>
          <li><strong>Photography considerations:</strong> Be aware that photographing in playground areas may concern parents. If you're photographing park scenery, avoid including unrelated children in your images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Everyone</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Report hazards:</strong> If you notice broken equipment, sharp edges, or other safety hazards, report them immediately through MPRC.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep pets away:</strong> Dogs should not be in playground areas, even if leashed.</li>
          <li><strong>No smoking:</strong> Never smoke in or near playground areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency awareness:</strong> Know the location of the playground and park entrance in case you need to describe it to emergency services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Blocking Prevention</h2>
        <p>Blocking pathways, entrances, facilities, or sight lines is one of the most common—and most frustrating—etiquette violations in parks. Being aware of how your position affects others prevents many conflicts.</p>

        <h3>Common Blocking Behaviors to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Path conversations:</strong> When you meet a friend on a path, both parties step to the side to chat rather than stopping in the center of the flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Entrance clustering:</strong> Don't gather immediately inside or outside park entrances, gates, or doorways.</li>
          <li><strong>Photo gathering:</strong> When taking photos, be aware of whether you're blocking paths or popular viewpoints. Take your photo and move on rather than extended photo sessions in high-traffic spots.</li>
          <li><strong>Equipment placement:</strong> Position bikes, strollers, picnic supplies, and other equipment so they don't obstruct paths.</li>
          <li><strong>Group formations:</strong> When your group gathers, form a cluster off the path rather than a line across it.</li>
          <li><strong>Device distraction:</strong> Looking at phones while walking often leads to sudden stops in inconvenient locations. Step aside if you need to use your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Being Aware of Sight Lines</h3>
        <p>Beyond physical blocking, consider whether you're blocking others' views:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At scenic viewpoints, take your photos and move to allow others access to the view</li>
          <li>At performances or events, consider the height of those behind you</li>
          <li>When children are watching something (street performance, wildlife), kneel down rather than standing in front of them</li>
          <li>Umbrellas and wide hats can block views—be aware of their impact</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step-by-Step: What to Do When Blocking</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Notice:</strong> Pay attention to whether people are trying to pass or access something you're near</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> Quickly consider if you're in the way or blocking access</li>
          <li><strong>Move:</strong> Step aside promptly and completely, not just a partial shuffle</li>
          <li><strong>Acknowledge:</strong> A brief "sorry" or smile acknowledges the situation positively</li>
          <li><strong>Prevent:</strong> When choosing where to stand or sit, proactively pick locations that won't require moving later</li>
        </ol>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Accessibility Awareness Tips</h2>
        <p>Parks should be welcoming and accessible to all visitors, including those with disabilities, mobility challenges, sensory impairments, or other special needs. Your awareness and consideration help create an inclusive environment for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Accessibility Needs</h3>
        <p>Accessibility needs are diverse and not always visible. People may need accommodations for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mobility challenges:</strong> Wheelchair users, people with walkers, canes, or crutches, those with limited endurance or pain conditions</li>
          <li><strong>Visual impairments:</strong> People who are blind or have low vision may use white canes, guide dogs, or need verbal assistance</li>
          <li><strong>Hearing impairments:</strong> People who are deaf or hard of hearing may not respond to verbal warnings and need visual cues</li>
          <li><strong>Cognitive or developmental differences:</strong> Some visitors may process information differently or need more time</li>
          <li><strong>Invisible disabilities:</strong> Chronic illness, chronic pain, mental health conditions, and other conditions that aren't visually apparent</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practical Accessibility Etiquette</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep paths clear:</strong> Never block accessible paths, ramps, or accessible parking areas, even "just for a minute"</li>
          <li><strong>Yield generously:</strong> When encountering wheelchair users or people with mobility devices, step completely off the path to let them pass</li>
          <li><strong>Don't touch mobility devices:</strong> Wheelchairs, walkers, and canes are extensions of the person—don't touch, lean on, or move them without permission</li>
          <li><strong>Guide dogs are working:</strong> Don't pet, distract, or feed guide dogs or service animals. They need to focus on their job.</li>
          <li><strong>Offer assistance appropriately:</strong> It's okay to offer help, but accept "no thank you" gracefully. Ask "Would you like assistance?" rather than assuming or insisting</li>
          <li><strong>Speak directly:</strong> When communicating with someone who has a disability, speak to them directly, not to their companion or caregiver</li>
          <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Allow extra time for people who move or communicate more slowly</li>
          <li><strong>Accessible facilities:</strong> Don't use accessible restrooms or facilities unless you need them</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reporting Accessibility Issues</h3>
        <p>If you notice accessibility problems in the park, report them through MPRC:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Damaged ramps or accessible pathways</li>
          <li>Obstacles blocking accessible routes</li>
          <li>Non-functioning accessible gates or doors</li>
          <li>Missing or damaged accessible parking signs</li>
          <li>Accessible restrooms that are locked or out of service</li>
          <li>Temporary obstacles (construction, event setup) that block accessible routes</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>Accessibility Benefits Everyone</h4>
          <p>Features designed for accessibility often benefit many users: ramps help parents with strollers, benches help those with fatigue, clear signage helps everyone navigate, and wide paths accommodate groups. Supporting accessibility isn't just about helping others—it makes the park better for everyone and for yourself when you might need these features.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions for Common Situations</h2>
        
        <h3>Situation: You're in a Group of 5 Walking on a Path</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Arrange yourselves in pairs (2-2) with one person walking ahead or behind, staying on the right side of the path</li>
          <li>Leave enough space between pairs for individuals to pass through if needed</li>
          <li>Designate the person at the back to watch for faster users approaching from behind</li>
          <li>When someone needs to pass, the person watching calls out "coming through on left"</li>
          <li>Everyone temporarily moves to single file on the right until the person passes</li>
          <li>Resume normal formation after the passer is well ahead</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Situation: You Find All Benches Occupied</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Look for alternatives: low walls, grassy areas, or other seating options</li>
          <li>If you need a bench specifically (elderly, injured, etc.), politely ask if someone might make room</li>
          <li>If benches have single occupants taking up full benches, ask "May I share this bench?"</li>
          <li>If someone is lying across a bench in a crowded area, a gentle "Excuse me, may I sit on the end?" is appropriate</li>
          <li>Be gracious whether the answer is yes or no</li>
          <li>Once seated, don't spread out yourself—leave room for others who may need to sit</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Situation: You Need to Take a Group Photo at a Popular Spot</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Wait your turn if others are already photographing</li>
          <li>Have your group ready before approaching the photo spot</li>
          <li>Set up your shot quickly—don't use the prime spot for endless adjustments</li>
          <li>Take 3-4 quick shots rather than an extended session</li>
          <li>Move away promptly when done to let others access the spot</li>
          <li>If there's a line forming, consider offering to take photos for others to build reciprocity</li>
          <li>Don't return to the back of the line for "just a few more"—you had your turn</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Situation: You Encounter Someone with a Wheelchair on a Narrow Path</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Make eye contact and smile to acknowledge them</li>
          <li>Step completely off the path onto the grass or side area</li>
          <li>If there's nowhere to step off, back up to the nearest wide spot</li>
          <li>Wait for them to pass completely before resuming your walk</li>
          <li>If they seem to be struggling with a rough section of path, ask "Would you like any help?"</li>
          <li>If they decline, simply say "Have a nice day" and continue on</li>
          <li>If they accept, ask specifically what would be helpful rather than just grabbing the wheelchair</li>
        </ol>
