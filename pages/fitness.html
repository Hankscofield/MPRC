        <h2>Jogging and Running Rules</h2>
        <p>Parks provide excellent spaces for jogging and running, offering a more pleasant environment than city streets. However, runners share these spaces with many other users and must do so considerately.</p>

        <h3>General Jogging Etiquette</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use designated paths:</strong> Stick to paths meant for running. Don't cut through grass, garden areas, or quiet zones.</li>
          <li><strong>Run on the right:</strong> Like walking, run on the right side of paths to maintain predictable traffic patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Announce when passing:</strong> Call out "on your left" or "passing" when approaching slower users from behind. Give them time to react before passing.</li>
          <li><strong>Pass with care:</strong> Give plenty of clearance when passing others, especially the elderly, children, and those with mobility aids.</li>
          <li><strong>Slow down when needed:</strong> Reduce speed in crowded areas, near playgrounds, at intersections, and when visibility is limited.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay aware:</strong> If using headphones, keep volume low enough to hear approaching users, cyclists, and warnings.</li>
          <li><strong>Control your sweat:</strong> Be aware that running generates sweat—avoid shaking off or getting too close to seated visitors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Running Direction and Loops</h3>
        <p>Many parks have established running directions for their main loops. This prevents head-on encounters between runners moving at speed. If you're new to a park:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Observe which direction other runners are moving</li>
          <li>Look for posted signs indicating preferred direction</li>
          <li>Ask regular park users about the convention</li>
          <li>If there's no established direction, run on the right and be prepared for oncoming traffic</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Early Morning and Evening Running</h3>
        <p>Peak running times have special considerations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dawn running:</strong> Share paths with tai chi groups, meditation practitioners, and elderly walkers. Modify your route or slow down around these activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> In low light, wear bright or reflective clothing so others can see you approaching.</li>
          <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Early and late hours call for quieter behavior—heavy breathing and footfalls are expected, but avoid loud music or talking.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Stay on lit paths when possible and remain alert to your surroundings.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Cycling Rules</h2>
        <p>Cycling in parks offers a pleasant alternative to road cycling, but cyclists must remember they are typically the fastest users on shared paths and bear extra responsibility for safety.</p>
        
        <h3>Basic Cycling Etiquette</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Know where cycling is allowed:</strong> Not all park paths permit cycling. Obey posted signs and stay off pedestrian-only paths.</li>
          <li><strong>Moderate your speed:</strong> Park paths are not for racing. Maintain speeds that allow you to stop quickly if needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Use a bell or voice:</strong> Always announce your approach to pedestrians. A bell works well, but a friendly "passing on your left" is also effective.</li>
          <li><strong>Give wide berth:</strong> When passing, give pedestrians as much space as possible, especially children, dogs, and groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Yield to pedestrians:</strong> Pedestrians always have right of way on shared paths. Slow down or stop if needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Dismount when required:</strong> In crowded areas, near playgrounds, or on narrow bridges, dismount and walk your bike.</li>
          <li><strong>Control your bike:</strong> Keep both hands ready to brake. Don't ride with no hands, text while riding, or carry items that impair control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Passing Safely</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Begin slowing down when approaching pedestrians from behind</li>
          <li>Ring bell or call out "passing on your left" from 10-15 meters away</li>
          <li>Wait for acknowledgment or at least a moment for the person to react</li>
          <li>Pass smoothly with at least 1 meter of clearance</li>
          <li>Don't speed up again until well clear of the pedestrian</li>
          <li>Thank the pedestrian as you pass or afterwards</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Special Situations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Children:</strong> Children are unpredictable—slow to near-walking speed when passing children, and be prepared for sudden movements.</li>
          <li><strong>Dogs:</strong> Leashes can cross paths unexpectedly. Pass dogs and their owners as a unit, not between them.</li>
          <li><strong>Groups:</strong> Wait for groups to organize themselves; don't try to squeeze through gaps that may close.</li>
          <li><strong>Oncoming cyclists:</strong> Both cyclists should move right. Make eye contact and acknowledge each other.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Group Workout Coordination</h2>
        <p>Group exercise—whether fitness classes, running groups, or informal workout buddies—brings special energy to parks but requires coordination with other users.</p>
        
        <h3>Planning Group Activities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choose appropriate locations:</strong> Select open areas away from quiet zones, pathways, and playgrounds. Fields and designated activity areas are ideal.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider timing:</strong> Avoid peak hours if your group is large or activities are space-intensive. Early morning or later afternoon often works well.</li>
          <li><strong>Check for permits:</strong> Large groups (typically 20+) or activities using equipment may require permits. Check with park management.</li>
          <li><strong>Notify park staff:</strong> Even if a permit isn't required, informing staff of regular group activities helps them plan and accommodate you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>During Group Workouts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contain your footprint:</strong> Keep activities within a defined area. Don't let participants drift into pathways or other users' spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Control noise:</strong> Count reps and give instructions at moderate volume. Avoid sustained shouting, screaming, or amplified sound.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch for passersby:</strong> Position a group member to warn when pedestrians approach so activities can pause or participants can make room.</li>
          <li><strong>Clean up equipment:</strong> If you bring cones, weights, mats, or other equipment, remove all of it when you finish.</li>
          <li><strong>Leave no trace:</strong> Leave the area as you found it or cleaner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Running Groups</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single file on paths:</strong> When running as a group on shared paths, form single file to allow passing.</li>
          <li><strong>Announce the group:</strong> Lead runner calls out "group coming" to alert pedestrians that multiple runners are approaching.</li>
          <li><strong>Pass efficiently:</strong> The group passes pedestrians as a unit, then reforms, rather than stringing out across a long distance.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid blocking intersections:</strong> Don't stop for regrouping at path intersections where you'll block traffic.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box info">
          <h4>Sharing the Dawn</h4>
          <p>Early morning is peak time for both fitness groups and traditional activities like tai chi and meditation. These activities can coexist harmoniously with mutual respect. Fitness groups should position themselves away from quiet activities, moderate noise levels, and respect that others also came early seeking a particular atmosphere. Tai chi groups should recognize that their activity, while quieter, also uses shared space that others may need to navigate around.</p>

                <p>Many parks offer outdoor fitness equipment—chin-up bars, parallel bars, exercise machines, and more. Using this equipment safely and sharing it fairly requires awareness and consideration.</p>

        <h2>Morning vs. Evening Behaviors</h2>
        <p>The park atmosphere changes throughout the day, and appropriate fitness behavior changes with it. Understanding these patterns helps you fit into the flow of park life.</p>
        
        <h3>Early Morning (5:00 AM - 7:00 AM)</h3>
        <p>Early morning is popular for both fitness activities and quieter pursuits. The park population typically includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tai chi and qigong groups</li>
          <li>Meditation practitioners</li>
          <li>Serious runners getting in miles before work</li>
          <li>Elderly walkers enjoying the cool air</li>
          <li>Nature observers watching birds and wildlife</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Appropriate behavior:</strong> Moderate noise levels, even during exercise. Respect quiet activities by maintaining distance and reducing vocal encouragement. This is not the time for loud music or group cheers.</p>

        <h3>Mid-Morning (7:00 AM - 10:00 AM)</h3>
        <p>Transition time when early users are leaving and daytime users arrive. Mixed activity levels with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Parents with young children</li>
          <li>Remaining fitness users</li>
          <li>Dog walkers</li>
          <li>Casual visitors</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Appropriate behavior:</strong> Moderate activity levels. Be especially watchful for children who may not be predictable in their movements. Good time for moderate-intensity workouts.</p>

        <h3>Afternoon (12:00 PM - 4:00 PM)</h3>
        <p>In Myanmar's climate, afternoon heat often reduces park usage, especially for vigorous exercise:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some picnickers in shaded areas</li>
          <li>Fewer fitness users due to heat</li>
          <li>Office workers on lunch breaks</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Appropriate behavior:</strong> If you do exercise in the afternoon, be mindful of heat effects on yourself and be extra considerate of the few other users who may be seeking shade and quiet during the hottest hours.</p>

        <h3>Evening (4:00 PM - 7:00 PM)</h3>
        <p>Peak park usage time with high energy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Post-work joggers and walkers</li>
          <li>Family groups with children</li>
          <li>Sports activities on fields</li>
          <li>Social gatherings</li>
          <li>Group fitness classes</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Appropriate behavior:</strong> Expect crowded paths and plan accordingly. More noise and activity is generally acceptable. However, as sunset approaches, transition to quieter behavior. Be especially visible if exercising in diminishing light.</p>

        <h3>Dusk and After (7:00 PM+)</h3>
        <p>As darkness falls, the park enters a quieter phase:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Couples and small groups enjoying cool evening air</li>
          <li>Night joggers on lit paths</li>
          <li>Those seeking peaceful reflection</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Appropriate behavior:</strong> Return to quieter modes. If jogging, stick to lit areas and wear reflective gear. Respect that others have come for evening peace. Group activities should wind down or relocate elsewhere.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Conflict-Prevention Tips</h2>
        <p>Despite best efforts, conflicts can arise between fitness users and others. These strategies help prevent and resolve conflicts peacefully.</p>
        
        <h3>Prevention Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choose locations wisely:</strong> Position your activities where they're least likely to conflict with other uses.</li>
          <li><strong>Be visible:</strong> Wear bright colors so others see you coming. Make eye contact to confirm mutual awareness.</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate early:</strong> Announce your approach well in advance, giving others time to respond.</li>
          <li><strong>Assume good intent:</strong> If someone does something annoying, assume it was unintentional rather than malicious.</li>
          <li><strong>Yield proactively:</strong> When in doubt, yield. Being right is less important than being safe and kind.</li>
          <li><strong>Manage expectations:</strong> Accept that parks are shared spaces and minor inconveniences are part of the experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When Conflicts Arise</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Don't escalate with angry words or gestures. Take a breath before responding.</li>
          <li><strong>Apologize if appropriate:</strong> If you contributed to the conflict, a simple "sorry about that" defuses tension.</li>
          <li><strong>Address issues politely:</strong> If you need to address someone's behavior, use "I" statements: "I feel unsafe when..." rather than "You shouldn't..."</li>
          <li><strong>Disengage if needed:</strong> If someone is being aggressive or unreasonable, it's okay to simply walk away.</li>
          <li><strong>Report persistent issues:</strong> If the same person or group consistently creates problems, report to MPRC rather than confronting repeatedly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Conflict Situations and Responses</h3>
        
        <div class="scenario-box good">
          <span class="scenario-label">Good Response</span>
          <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A jogger nearly collides with a walker who stepped unexpectedly into the path.</p>
          <p><strong>Good Response (Jogger):</strong> "Whoa, sorry about that! You okay?" even if the walker was at fault.</p>
          <p><strong>Good Response (Walker):</strong> "Sorry, I didn't hear you coming! I should watch where I'm going."</p>
          <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Mutual acknowledgment, everyone continues peacefully, no lingering resentment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scenario-box bad">
          <span class="scenario-label">Poor Response</span>
          <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Same near-collision.</p>
          <p><strong>Poor Response (Jogger):</strong> "Watch where you're going!" while continuing without slowing.</p>
          <p><strong>Poor Response (Walker):</strong> "Slow down, this isn't a racetrack!" shouted at the jogger's back.</p>
          <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Both parties are upset, negative feelings about parks, possible escalation if they encounter each other again.</p>
