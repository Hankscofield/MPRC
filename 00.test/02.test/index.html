        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>The Myanmar Park Report Center (MPRC) serves as a vital bridge between community members and government authorities responsible for maintaining our precious public parks and green spaces. We believe that every citizen has the right to enjoy clean, safe, and well-maintained outdoor areas, and that collective action is the key to achieving this vision.</p>
        <p>Through our platform, residents can report issues, share observations, and contribute to the ongoing effort of keeping Myanmar's parks beautiful for current and future generations. Whether you've noticed overflowing trash bins, damaged playground equipment, or areas that need attention, your voice matters in creating positive change.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>Why Your Participation Matters</h4>
          <p>Parks are the lungs of our cities—they provide essential green spaces for recreation, relaxation, and community gathering. When community members actively participate in reporting and maintaining these spaces, we create a culture of shared responsibility that benefits everyone.</p>

          <ol>

            <li><strong>Report:</strong> Use our simple reporting system to document the issue with details and photos.</li>
            <li><strong>Track:</strong> Monitor the status of your report as it moves through our system to the appropriate government agency.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Receive updates when action is taken and the issue is resolved.</li>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Community Impact</h2>
        <p>When communities come together to care for their shared spaces, remarkable things happen. Parks become cleaner, safer, and more inviting. Children have better places to play, families enjoy healthier outdoor activities, and neighborhoods develop stronger bonds through shared stewardship.</p>
        <p>The MPRC has facilitated thousands of reports across Myanmar, leading to meaningful improvements in parks large and small. From major urban green spaces to neighborhood playgrounds, every report contributes to a larger vision of well-maintained public areas for all.</p>
