        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>The Myanmar Park Report Center (MPRC) exists to bridge the gap between community members and the government agencies responsible for maintaining our public green spaces. We believe that every citizen has both the right and the responsibility to contribute to the upkeep of the parks that serve their communities.</p>
        <p>Through our platform, we enable residents to report issues, share observations, and actively participate in the improvement of parks throughout Myanmar. By facilitating direct communication between citizens and authorities, we help ensure that problems are identified quickly and addressed efficiently.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>

These green spaces are essential to public health, community connection, and quality of life. Our goal is to create a culture of shared stewardship where citizens and government work together to protect and improve these valuable resources.</p>
