      <h2>Using Equipment Safely</h2>
      <p>Many parks offer outdoor fitness equipment—chin-up bars, parallel bars, exercise machines, and more. Using this equipment safely and sharing it fairly requires awareness and consideration.</p>

      <h3>Personal Safety Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inspect before use:</strong> Check equipment for damage, loose bolts, or wear before using. Report any issues to MPRC.</li>
          <li><strong>Understand the equipment:</strong> If you're not sure how to use something, observe others or look for instructional signs.</li>
          <li><strong>Warm up first:</strong> Cold muscles are injury-prone. Do light warm-up exercises before using resistance equipment.</li>
          <li><strong>Know your limits:</strong> Don't attempt exercises beyond your current ability. Build up gradually.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain control:</strong> Move through exercises with control, not momentum. This is safer and more effective.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch your surroundings:</strong> Be aware of space around you, especially when using equipment that involves swinging or extending limbs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

            <h3>Sharing Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reasonable time limits:</strong> When others are waiting, limit yourself to 10-15 minutes per piece of equipment, or 2-3 sets of exercises.</li>
          <li><strong>Work in:</strong> It's acceptable to ask "Mind if I work in?" when someone is between sets. Alternate sets efficiently.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't monopolize:</strong> Avoid "circuiting" through multiple pieces of equipment in a way that ties them all up.</li>
          <li><strong>Yield to others:</strong> If you're resting, don't sit on equipment. Step away so others can use it.</li>
          <li><strong>Help if asked:</strong> If someone asks for a spot or how to use equipment, help if you're able.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hygiene and Maintenance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wipe equipment:</strong> If you sweat heavily, consider bringing a towel to wipe handles after use.</li>
          <li><strong>Report damage:</strong> If you notice damaged or dangerous equipment, report it through MPRC immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't modify:</strong> Never attempt to adjust, repair, or modify park equipment yourself.</li>
          <li><strong>No food or drinks:</strong> Keep food and sugary drinks away from equipment to prevent attracting pests and creating mess.</li>
        </ul>
